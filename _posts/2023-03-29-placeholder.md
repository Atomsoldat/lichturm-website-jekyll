title: Save electricity by measuring your machine's consumption 
---

Who does not like to have a large pile of electronical hardware sitting at home? Even better if it actually works and can be used for something. I have been meaning to measure my various server's energy consumption for a while and *i am glad i did* (you probably will be too if you are like me). I keep shuffling the hard drives that make up my NAS-storage around between different machines whenever i need to work on the one they are currently in. They ended up running inside a server that i got to take home when it was mustered out.
