title: Save electricity by measuring your machine's consumption 
---

I've been meaning to measure the power consumption of my electronic devices for years now. I did now, and you should too!

Who does not like to have a large pile of electronical hardware sitting at home? Even better if it actually works and can be used for something. I have been meaning to measure my various server's energy consumption for a while and *i am glad i did* (you probably will be too if you are like me). I keep shuffling the hard drives that make up my NAS-storage around between different machines whenever i need to work on the one they are currently in. They ended up running inside a server that i got to take home when it was mustered out (CPU Model MAINBOARD MODEL - archeotech, but it runs fine). It turns out that one ended up running at 75 W idle though, while other servers idled at 35 W or 20 W with the same disks. So guess which ones will be running 24/7 from now on. The power meter will have paid for itself in a few weeks just by informing me of this. The laptop i type this on consumes 10 W idling by the way and 20 W while watching videos.
